## Array nested multiline 2

Original php code:

```php
return ['a', ['x' => 'People say that drinking water is important', 'y' => 'But how can we drink water in space?'], 'c', [[]]];
```

Prettified code:

```php
return ['a', [
  'x' => 'People say that drinking water is important',
  'y' => 'But how can we drink water in space?',
], 'c', [[]]];
```
