## Array simple multiline

Original php code:

```php
return ['long text with many words',  'longer text with manyer words',  'elongated text which has more words than the previous text found in this array', 'short text'];
```

Prettified code:

```php
return [
  'long text with many words',
  'longer text with manyer words',
  'elongated text which has more words than the previous text found in this array',
  'short text',
];
```
